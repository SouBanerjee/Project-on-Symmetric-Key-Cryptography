Using Turbo Assembler 4.0 with Turbo C++ 4.5
==============================================
Turbo Assembler 4.0 is fully compatible with Turbo C++ 4.5.  There is
an error in the WHEREIS example program which will cause two undefined
symbol errors when built.  The following corrections will resolve the
problem:

mov es,[es:psp.EnvironmentBlock]
to:
mov es,[es:Psp.EnvironmentBlock]

mov ax, [ComSpecSeg]
to:
mov ax, [ComspecSeg]

to:
call WriteASCIIZString,ds,offset Syntax



OWL 1, Object-Based Class Library, and Turbo C++ 4.5
====================================================

Due to changes in the debug information format, symbol length, and
runtime library, the OWL 1 and class library .LIB files do not
work with Turbo C++ 4.5.  Turbo C++ programs built with the old
libraries must be converted in order for Turbo C++ 4.5 to build them.

The OWLCVT utility can help you move from OWL 1 to OWL 2.5.  OWLCVT
is described in the Turbo C++ for Windows Users Guide.
